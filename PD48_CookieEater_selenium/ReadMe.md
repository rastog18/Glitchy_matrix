# Cookie Clicker Automation

This Python script uses Selenium to automate the Cookie Clicker game (http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/). It continuously clicks on the cookie to earn cookies and purchases items when they become available. The automation runs for a specified duration (5 minutes by default) and calculates the cookies per second (CPS) at the end.

## Requirements
- Python
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver

## Usage
1. Install Python if you haven't already.
2. Install the Selenium library using `pip install selenium`.
3. Download the Chrome WebDriver and specify its path in the code (or add it to your system's PATH).
4. Run the script.

## How to Run
```bash
python cookie_clicker_automation.py
