I am a kind of person who usually "likes the song" that I want to listen to instead of adding them to a specific playlist.

Problem: If and when someone likes my song-choice, they usaally ask for my playlist. And add all of my liked songs (i.e 400+) it quite difficult.

Solution: The program just requires one to give his/her "developer id" and "password", The program will then Create a new playlist and add all your liked songs into it.
